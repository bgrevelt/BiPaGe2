# BiPaGe2
Generate parsers for binary data based on a format description

# Notes
For terminology: Use the term capture scope for the braces we use to determine the capture type for non-standard width types. E.g
```
Foo
{
  field1: u8;
  { // <--
    field2: u5;
    field3: i11:
  } // <--
}
```

To explain: We use capture scope because it's the only way to support non-standard width types coming from a big endian platform. See more details in #23

Make sure to note that **the project does not support big endian platforms**. That doesn't mean that we don't support data coming from big endian platforms, but the code generated by the compiler will not perform properly on big endian platforms. The reason for this is that the effort required to support big endian platforms (especially for testing) is too high at this time. Support for big endian platforms can always be added at a later stage.
